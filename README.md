# PokeObject

## Disclaimer
I do not own nor claim any of the resources used in this (other than my code) as mine. This was just a simple weekly assignment to get used to basic Object-Oriented Programming in university, nothing fancy. I really liked how it turned out so I'm putting it here. :)

## Assignment Requirements
Lab 1 Requirements:
- Create and instantiate 3 different entities
- Allow for movement at different speeds, depending on entity

Lab 2 Requirements:
- Create a Brain superclass to control the movement of the entities

Lab 3 Requirements:
- Add Collidable and NonCollidable Entities and prevent collision/overlap between collidable entities

Lab 4 Requirements:
- Convert Pokemon, iCollidable, Collidable and NonCollidable to use generic type parameters and implement cloneable
- Show that cloned entity retains the collision functionality

Extra Stuff:
- Neat background to match Pokémon theme

## Controls
- W A S D to move!
- G to swap characters!
- SPACEBAR for special move! (currently just soutput)

## Additional Notes:
- There are some variables that aren't used at the moment but will be used for future updates e.g. type so bear with me <3
